![# Streaming in a Pandemic](https://gdurl.com/fD4V)


This is an analysis of how Twitch.tv trends are changing. I was curious about how streaming behavior on Twitch was shifting since the coronavirus lockdown measures, as well as the business implications for influencer marketing. So, I made it my capstone project at Nashville Software School ([NSS](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/)).


 The two primary business questions I focused my analysis on were: 
 
 1. How are consumer streaming trends changing amid the coronavirus pandemic? 
 2. Based on those trends, how should content companies reach consumers?” 
 
 
Below is an overview for how I approached the project, and a Tableau dashboard visualizing my findings. I've also included data and directions if you'd like to do your own analysis on these trends.

## Process

Findthe data, clean it, and do a thorough exploratory data analysis. I then extracted, transformed, and merged 106 datasets spanning 2016 - 2020 into one dataframe. The primary tools I used were Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Tableau, and API data from Twitch.tv. Lastly, I used Tableau to create dashboards where my insights can be visualized. 

## Dashboard

[My Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/views/StreamingInAPandemic-TwitchAnalysis/AnalysisOverview?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link) includes some of the visualizations I made for this project, as well as Influencer Tool.

It’s now open to the public for anyone to use for further analysis. If you'd like to do your own analysis from start to finish, follow these steps:

## Data

I titied up all the data I used into this cenral dataset. If you'd like to create your own analysis using it, the file is in the [data folder](https://github.com/jackmccann/streaming_analysis_amid_pandemic/tree/master/data) under:

```

```

## Motivation

I considered quite a few options for my capstone, but ultimately choosing this subject came down to following my own intellectual curiosity to solve a practical business need in influenecr marketing.

## Versioning

This is the first version of the project. It utilizes datasets I cleaned up in Python using Jupyter Notebook. If you perform your own analysis, I recommend going with the Twitch.tv API to gather the latest endpoints as the data I have attached here is current to May 2020.

Be sure to use the latest version of Twitch's API that which authenticates vias OAuth 2.0, then follow the documentation here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/insights/
