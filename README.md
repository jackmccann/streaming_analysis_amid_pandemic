# streaming_analysis_amid_pandemic

Capstone Proposal v2

Question
•	How has consumer content consumption changed since the pandemic?
•	How are advertisers adapting to reach these consumers?

Motivation 
•	The coronavirus has completely shifted the way the world consumes content and the ways businesses reach customer segments with content. Companies are scrambling to adapt. As I move back into the workforce it makes sense to be able to empower my future employer with that knowledge.
•	I have significant experience at the intersection of content and marketing. Doubling down on the analytics of this subject was a primary motivation for taking this class. What better way to market my professional development than to connect the dots between my business experience and my newly acquired analytics skillsets.
•	Consumer streaming preferences are accelerating. For example, Analysts predicted Netflix would globally gain about 7 million new subscribers over the entire 1st quarter of the year. They didn’t. They acquired 15.8 million in March alone.  Previously the highest customer acquisitions were only 9.6 million (Q1 2019). Meanwhile, Disney-owned ESPN saw a ratings drop of nearly 50% on some of their properties such as the Golf Channel. They’re hemorrhaging advertisers and revenue. Disney’s media empire is triaging assets. However, subscribers to their streaming platform, Disney + are up to 54 million in the first quarter, beating analyst predictions by around 20 mil. All that sounds great, but both companies face a boiling point. 
•	Advertisers are adapting. It shouldn't be considered a “new” trend, but rather an acceleration of market forces that were already in play. It’s more accurate to illustrate that the pandemic has been a catalyst for trends already in motion. 
•	It’s relevant to the industry I’ll go to work in shortly.
•	It stimulates my intellectual curiosity
•	I have accessible data on the subject to support analysis

Known Issues and Challenges
•	Time. 80% of this is going to be finding and cleaning the data. I’ve allocated most of my time and energy to this alone. For consistent execution I’m leveraging pomadoro method, agile scrum methodology, and Asana kanbans.
